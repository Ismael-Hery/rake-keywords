Rake
====

Rake is a Javascript implementation of the "Rake" keywords extraction algorithm, as described in 'Rose, S., Engel, D., Cramer, N., & Cowley, W. (2010). Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents. In M. W. Berry & J. Kogan (Eds.), Text Mining: Theory and Applications: John Wiley & Sons.'

Test have shown to give equal or better quality of extracted keywords compared to commercial API.

## How to use


## Some problems with the Rake original scientific paper

### Errors in the paper

* 'numbers' is a stop word in the original Fox stop words list, thus 'natural numbers' can not be a candidate keywords. I removed numbers from the Fox stop list as they probably did for the paper (otherwise they would not have found 'natural numbers')
* the paper does not find mixed types as a candidate keywords. I've added mixed types as a candidates key words

### Non english language

## TODO :

* optionnaly exclude 'ing' words (with unit tests)
* compute keywords from a corpus of articles (see sci paper with computation of 'essential' keywords)
* French implementation with 'mots de liaisons' du/des/d'/â€¦ excluded from stop list
